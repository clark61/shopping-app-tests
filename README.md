# Shopping App Tests

## About
For DePaul's Fall 2021 Software Testing course, we were tasked with 
testing a single page shopping application. While we did not create the
shopping app, the requirements are listed [here](https://github.com/clark61/shopping-app-tests/blob/main/ShoppingApp-requirements.pdf).

To test the shopping app I used:
-   normal boundary tests
-   equivalence partitioning tests
-   mock tests
-   functional tests
-   code coverage analysis
-   static analysis

The overall readiness report can be checked out [here](https://github.com/clark61/shopping-app-tests/blob/main/Readiness%20Report%20-%20Shopping%20App.pdf).
